Clustering UI Demo
=========================================

For this demo, the flow is going to be broken up into 3 main portions.  

1. A User overview, for now this will be just me without any sort of "selection" option
  - `UserView.jsx`
2. An cluster selection page (this will not actually select a cluster, just jumps to next view)
  - `ClusterView.jsx`
3. A view of the documents within a cluster.
  - `ClusterDocumentsView.jsx`
